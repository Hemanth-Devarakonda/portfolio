## System Analyst at Netcracker Technology Solutions
### 2019 - till date

As a system Analyst, I've created multiple Utilities on IBM I server to ease impact analysis, identify bad data in the data base
files, masking customer data. 

All the user interfaces created are generated using CASE tool SYNON 2E. 

Investigated multiple system issues and implemented permanent fixes.
